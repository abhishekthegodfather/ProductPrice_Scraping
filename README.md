This program scrap the prices of the product from different website like amazon, flipkart and chroma and make into csv files. The scrappingg is done on the basis of product name like if we want to scarp the prices of new iphone se just enter the name when running the python file and it will scarp the prices from these website and make into csv. the information like discounted prices, original price and dilevary date, offers are scrap from the website. 

This Script is written in python3 and the library used is Selenium. This Selenium library handles the all the automation stuff like opening of browser , put request to website fill search box and scraping stuff.

For using the selenium first download the geckodriver driver which is a driver for firefox browser and chromedriver for chrome browser. I used so Firefox browser so, i have included the geckodriver in this repository so, no need to download externally.
